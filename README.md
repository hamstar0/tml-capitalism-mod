# Capitalism

Town NPCs are now stingy and adhere to the rule of supply & demand. Popular items now (temporarily) get their prices marked up.

* Formula for item markup (b=base value, t=total purchases):
	b + ( (b * t)^0.8 ) / 50
* Config file in Documents/My Games/Terraria/ModLoader/Mod Configs/Capitalism Config.json
